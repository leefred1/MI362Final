                  <h1>What is League of Legends?</h1>
		  <p class="lead">League of Legends is a competitive video game played between two teams of 5.</p>
		  <p>The objective of the game is to destroy the heart of the other team's base called the "Nexus." The Nexus is protected by numerous turrets and other structures.</p>
		  <img class="imageformland" src="lolimage1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="summoner's rift">
		  <h6>Showed above is the map of where the game is played on.</h6>
		  <p>This style of gameplay is called a MOBA, or a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. The game was released by Riot Games in 2010 and the playerbase has only been growing since then. The fun gameplay mechanics and competitive team gameplay allow it to be played both casually and competitively. Because of this, it has quickly become the biggest and most popular online video game in the world.</p>
		  <img class="imageformport" src="lolimage2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="LoL playerbase">
		  <h6>Showed above is a part of Riot Games' playerbase infographic.</h6>
		  <p>However, the game mechanics and the team gameplay is not the only reason why I love this game so much.</p>
		  <img class="imageformport" src="customimage2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="team at pax">
		  <h6>Showed above is a picture MSU's League of Legends team at a convention called PAX East.</h6>
		  <p>As of right now, League of Legends has the biggest scene in all of competitive video gaming. Professional teams play in leagues in their respective regions similarly to profesional leagues in Football, Soccer, and Basketball leagues. There are also various tournaments held over the year with the World Championship tournament being the climax biggest of it all. Most tournaments have prize pools of $500,000 dollars or less, but the World Championship has a prize pool of $2 million.</p>

		  <h6>Showed above is one of the League of Legends World Championship venues: The Staples Center.</h6>
		  <p class="lead">Professional players are paid 6 digits and even more if they livestream their gameplay to an audience.</p>
		  <p>The reason why the picture above is so significant is because history was made that weekend.</p>
		  <p class="lead">The MSU League of Legends team was invited to play at a Big Ten Network Invitational for League of Legends at PAX East.</p>
		  <p>Yes, the same Big Ten Network that broadcasts college sports. The Big Ten Network broadcasted and livestreamed a League of Legends game between MSU and OSU. Until now, even though the professional scene was maturing at an unbelievable rate, the collegiate scene was still light years behind. Now that the Big Ten Network has started recognizing and acknowledging the existence of E-Sports, the collegiate League of Legends scene will start to see growth and hopefully, will eventually grow into a real college spectator (E)sport.</p>
