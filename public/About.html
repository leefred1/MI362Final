                  <h1>About Me...</h1>
		  <p class="lead">My name is Fred Lee.</p>
		  <p>I am a Korean American and my birthday is on September 27th, 1995. My parents were born in Korea, but I was born in America. I have one little brother that is 7 years younger than I am. Fun Fact: the age gap between me and my brother is the same as the age gap between my parents!</p>
		  <p>I'm currently working on my Bachelor's degree for Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University. On the surface, it seems as if I'm studying to try and earn a stable living.</p>
		  <p class="lead">BUT I want to do much more than that.</p>
		  <img class="imageformland" src="Aboutimage1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="stadium picture">
		  <p></p>
		  <p>I am a video game fanatic. But not just any video game fanatic, but an extremely competitive video game fanatic. What you see above is the stadium where the grand finals of a video game tournament were held. My dream is to be a part of this phenomenon called E-Sports. It matters not whether I contribute as a competitor, creator, or supporter; my dream is to witness E-Sports being held in the same regard as regular sports.</p>
		  <p class="lead">On a side note, my favorite food is Korean. Specifically Korean BBQ.</p>
		  <p>Sushi gets a very close second.</p>
